HTML, CSS and JavaScript game developed by me!

This is my version of Flappy Bird. So how did I make it? Credits go to my Udemy teacher TUDOR TUDORESCU. He was typing and I was copying, then I made some few changes.

So how do you play this game? 

1. Download the game files.
2. You need a web server app to run the JavaScript code in the browser. A chrome extension will do.
3. Run the game and enjoy!

This game has room for a lot of improvement. I would like to fix:

1. The lag that happens when the speed changes.
2. I would like to create a ranking system and a leaderboard.
3. The graphics in general and the pictures have room for a lot of improvement.
4. Make the game playable on phone and tablet.
5. Have a login and text-chat system in the game.

There are some unnecessary commented out commands, these are kept for testing purposes.

If you would like to make changes in this repository, then message me at my email which is mxwk77@gmail.com or on my Discord which is MXWK#6513 and I will get back to you ASAP.

By the way, the game is live on this link https://flappymxwk.mxwclan.com/

That is all, hope you like the game!

Have a good day!
